Project 2 Proposal: Extract, Transform, Load

For our project we are looking to see if there is a correlation between US minimum wage and the frequency of US hate crimes. 
We will do this by grouping by both state and year; this will also allow us to compare hate crimes and minimum wage within a state over time. 
We plan to clean the data on the CSV files and choose which columns weâ€™d like to use in our comparisons. 
Then we will merge the data frames together to create a side-by-side comparison of the data. 
We plan to create our tables in Postgres, because we are looking at relational datasets.
